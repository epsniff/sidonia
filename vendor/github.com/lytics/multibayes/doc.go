// Multiclass naive Bayesian document classification.
//
// While multinomial Bayesian classification offers
// one-of-many classification, multibayes offers tools
// for many-of-many classification.  The multibayes
// library strives to offer efficient storage and
// calculation of multiple Bayesian posterior classification
// probabilities.
