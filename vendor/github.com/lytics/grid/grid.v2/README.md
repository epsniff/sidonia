grid
====

Grid is a library to build distributed processes. A library in contrast to being a container.
It is  simple to use and provides the basic building blocks for distributed processing:

 1. Passing messages, which in grid is done via [NATS](http://nats.io/).
 1. Coordinating task instances, which in grid is done via [ETCD](https://github.com/coreos/etcd).
 1. Scheduling tasks across the processes, which in grid is done via [METAFORA](https://github.com/lytics/metafora).

### Quick Introduction

Configuring and starting are done in two lines:
```go
g := grid.New(name, etcdservers, natsservers, actormaker)
g.Start()
```

Scheduling work is done by calling StartActor:
```go
g.StartActor(grid.NewActorDef("hello"))
```

Scheduled units of work are called actors, which are made by user code implementing the ActorMaker interface:
```go
func (m *actormaker) MakeActor(def grid.ActorDef) (Actor, error) {
    switch def.Type {
    case "hello":
        return &HelloActor{def}, nil
    case "other":
        return &OtherActor{def}, nil
    }
}
```

An actor is any Go type that implements the two methods of the Actor interface:
```go
type Actor interface {
    ID() {
    Act(g grid.Grid, exit <-chan bool) bool {
}
```

An actor can communicate with any other actor it knows the name of:
```go
func (a *helloactor) Act(g grid.Grid, exit <-chan bool) bool {
    tx, _ := grid.NewSender(g.Nats(), ...)
    tx.Send("other", "hello")
    return true
}

func (a *otheractor) Act(g grid.Grid, exit <-chan bool) bool {
    rx, _ := grid.NewReceiver(g.Nats(), ...)
    for {
        select {
        case <-exit:
            return true
        case m := <-rx.Msgs():
            log.Printf("got message: %v", m)
            return true
        }
    }
}
```

An actor can schedule other actors:
```go
func (a *leaderactor) Act(g grid.Grid, exit <-chan bool) bool {
    for i:= 0; i<10; i++ {
        name := fmt.Sprintf("follower-%d", i)
        g.StartActor(grid.NewActorDef(name).DefineType("follower"))
    }
    return true
}
```

Each actor has access to Etcd for state and coordination:
```go
func (a *statefulactor) Act(g grid.Grid, exit <-chan bool) bool {
    ttl := uint64(30)
    loc := strings.Join([]string{g.Name(), "state", a.ID()}, "/")
    etc := g.Etcd()
    etc.Create(loc, "state", ttl)
    return true
}
```

Each actor can use the Sender and Receiver interfaces for communication, but it
can also use Nats directly:
```go
func (a *otheractor) Act(g grid.Grid, exit <-chan bool) bool {
    g.Nats().Publish("announce", "hello")
    return true
}
```

### Ring and Condition

Two helper libraries are included to help with coordination tasks, [condition](condition/), and
message sending tasks for divide and conquer, [ring](ring/).

### Sender and Receiver

Though NATS can be used directly, two interface are available for convenience.
`Sender` provides a buffered sender with ack requests and resends. `Receiver`
provides a receiver that acks, and can start multiple subscriber go-routines
internally to read incoming messages.

### Getting Started With Examples

Running the examples requires Etcd and Nats services running on `localhost`. Do the following to
get both running on your system:

Etcd, get and run:

    $ go get -u github.com/coreos/etcd
    $ etcd
    2015/08/31 11:06:08 etcdmain: listening for client requests on http://localhost:2379
    ...

Nats, get and run:

    $ go get -u github.com/nats-io/gnatsd
    $ gnatsd
    2015/08/31 11:07:19.925048 [INF] Listening for client connections on 0.0.0.0:4222
    ...

The [firstgrid](example/firstgrid/) example is the simplest. It starts two actors and they pass messages.
Very little error checking is done but the basics are all there.

The [flowgrid](example/flowgrid/) example is much more involved, but more realistic as it deals with
coordination using the [condition](condition/) library and [ring](ring/) library. It also adds random
failure to each actor to simulate how dealing with such failures can be dealt with using the
[dfa](http://github.com/lytics/dfa) library.
